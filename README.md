I made it just 4days before the First sem final exams. It acutally has a kinda tragic story behind it 

I broke my left elbow a month ago & had to undergo Surgery 
I was still recovering (Learning flutter with one hand as I had time to kill at Home)
I had just finished making my first Application( mujhePaisaDo which didn't actually do much . So , I thought of making something that may actually help some people including me.

At that time , I was trying to collect all the Notes & then it came to my mind that , many of my fellow batchmates may be facing the Same problem . Hence I tried to make something that may solve it 
Hence , "P-cycle_notes" (vtu notes) was created .
